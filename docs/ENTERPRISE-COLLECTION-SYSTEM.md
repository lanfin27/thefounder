```
http://localhost:3000/admin/scraping
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Delay between requests**: 8-12 seconds

### Enterprise Mode
- **Pages/minute**: 10-15
- **Listings/minute**: 250-300
- **Success rate**: 95%+
- **Resource usage**: High (multi-CPU)
- **Delay between requests**: 8-10 seconds per worker

## Data Extraction Quality

### Fields Extracted

- Price data (20 points)
- Monthly profit data (20 points)
- Monthly revenue data (15 points)
- Profit multiple (10 points)
- Revenue multiple (10 points)
- Property type (5 points)

## Best Practices

### 1. **Scheduling**
- Run during off-peak hours (2 AM - 6 AM EST)
- Limit to once per day maximum
- Use professional mode for regular updates

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- Never reduce delays below 5 seconds
- Monitor server responses for rate limiting
- Stop immediately if blocked

### 3. **Data Management**
- Regular database backups
- Monitor storage usage
- Clean old data periodically

### 4. **Monitoring**
```bash
# Watch real-time logs
tail -f professional-scraper.log

# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check database size
psql -c "SELECT pg_database_size('flippa_db');"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Timeout Errors**
- Increase delays between requests
- Check internet connection stability
- Verify website accessibility

#### 2. **Low Extraction Rate**
- Website structure may have changed
- Update extraction patterns
- Check console errors in logs

#### 3. **Database Errors**
- Verify Supabase credentials
- Check storage limits
- Review error logs

### Error Recovery
```bash
# If collection fails, data is backed up to:
data/professional-backup-[timestamp].json
data/enterprise-backup-[timestamp].json

# Restore from backup
node scripts/restore-from-backup.js data/professional-backup-123456.json
```
