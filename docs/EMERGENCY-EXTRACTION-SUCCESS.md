## 🔧 Technical Solution

### Root Cause:
- CSS selectors were completely wrong for Flippa's Angular structure
- Previous extractors didn't handle `ng-repeat="listing in results"`

### Fix Applied:
1. **Emergency HTML Inspector** - Analyzed real Flippa structure
2. **Angular-Aware Extraction** - Proper handling of ng-repeat
3. **Multi-Strategy Extraction** - Fallbacks for different page structures

## 📊 Data Quality

### Sample Listings:
```json
{
  "id": "11052740",
  "title": "Confidential Listing - NDA Required",
  "url": "https://flippa.com/11052740",
  "price": 517,
  "multiple": 3.8,
  "type": "Content",
  "verified": true
}
```

### Key Findings:
- Many listings are confidential (require NDA)
- Prices range from $6 to $526,420
- Multiples range from 0.9x to 14.29x
- 82.6% of listings are verified

## 🚀 Next Steps

To achieve even better results:

1. **Enhanced Title Extraction**:

2. **Revenue Extraction**:
   - Current: 2.3% (needs improvement)
   - Solution: Extract from listing detail pages

3. **Continuous Extraction**:
