# Puppeteer API Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The scrapers were failing with the error:
```
❌ this.page.waitForTimeout is not a function
```

This occurred because `page.waitForTimeout()` was deprecated in newer versions of Puppeteer.

## Solution
Replaced all instances of `waitForTimeout` with Promise-based `setTimeout`:

### Before (Deprecated)
```javascript
await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
await this.page.waitForTimeout(delay);
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
```

## Files Updated
1. **unified-marketplace-scraper.js** - 3 replacements
2. **professional-flippa-scraper.js** - 4 replacements  
3. **enterprise-flippa-collector.js** - 2 replacements
4. **flippa-scraper-adaptive.js** - 6 replacements
5. **flippa-scraper-enhanced.js** - 3 replacements

## Testing
Created `test-puppeteer-fix.js` to verify the fix:
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Wait timings are accurate
- ✅ Page functionality maintained
- ✅ Marketplace detection functional

## Usage Pattern
For any future Puppeteer scripts, use this pattern for delays:

```javascript
// Fixed delay
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

// Dynamic delay
const delay = calculateDelay();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));

// With logging
logger.info(`Waiting ${delay}ms...`);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
```

## Compatibility
This fix works with all Puppeteer versions, both old and new, making the code forward-compatible.
