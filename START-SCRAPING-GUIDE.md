# 🚀 TheFounder Flippa Scraping System - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ System Status
All components validated and ready for activation!

## 📋 Required Steps (Run in separate terminals)

### Terminal 1: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Wait for: "Ready on http://localhost:3000"

### Terminal 2: Start Worker Process
```bash
npm run worker
```
Wait for: "Worker is ready and processing jobs..."

### Terminal 3: Test Scraping (Optional)
```bash
npm run scrape:test
```
This will test scraping with a single category (SaaS)

### Terminal 4: Start Full Scraping System
```bash
npm run scrape:start
```
This will begin scraping all 15 categories

### Terminal 5: Monitor Progress
```bash
npm run monitor
```
This shows real-time scraping progress

## 🎯 Alternative: Run Everything at Once
If you have the terminals available, you can use:
```bash
npm run start:scraping
```
This runs dev server, worker, and monitor concurrently.
