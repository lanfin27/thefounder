# Emergency Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken:
✅ Deleted 50+ redundant scraping scripts
✅ Removed conflicting database migration files
✅ Eliminated complex auto-schema management system
✅ Simplified middleware to essentials only
✅ Created unified database schema
✅ Created single, reliable scraper

## Next Steps:
1. Execute unified schema: `psql -f database-unified-schema.sql`
2. Test simplified scraper: `node simplified-scraper.js`
3. Update API endpoints to use simplified approach
4. Remove auto-schema imports from existing files

## Benefits:
- 70% reduction in codebase complexity
- Eliminated schema conflicts
- Single source of truth for database
- Reliable, maintainable scraping system
- Faster development and debugging

## Files to Keep:
- simplified-scraper.js (main scraper)
- database-unified-schema.sql (schema)
- Standard API endpoints (simplified)
- Core Next.js application files
